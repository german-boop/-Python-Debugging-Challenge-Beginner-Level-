## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will learn to:

- Detect and fix common Python bugs
- Understand basic logic and runtime errors
- Write clean and maintainable code
- Follow **PEP 8** coding standards
- Improve software quality based on **ISO/IEC 25010**

## 🧩 Challenge Description

You are given a Python function that is supposed to calculate the **average of a list of numbers**.

The original version of the function contains:
- A syntax error
- A logic error
- No handling for empty input

Your task is to modify the function so that it functions correctly and adheres to best practices.

## ❌ Buggy Code

```python
def average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for n in numbers
        total += n
    return total

## 📌 Requirements

Python 3.x

No external libraries

Beginner-friendly implementation
