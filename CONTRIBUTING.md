### 🔹 Pragmatic Notes

- **CONTRIBUTING.md** is a conventional file in open-source projects that tells contributors:
  - How to report issues
  - How to submit pull requests
  - How to follow coding standards

- **ISO/IEC 25010 Maintainability:**  
  Maintainability refers to how easily a project can be modified, updated, or extended; adding clear documentation helps achieve this.

- **GitHub UX Best Practices:**  
  Users can quickly understand how to contribute when they view the repository. Clear documentation, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines improve approachability and collaboration.


###  Recommended Display for README

After the tree structure, you can add a short description for each file:

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Guidelines for contributing to this project.
- **`average.py`**: Main Python function `calculate_average`.
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests for the project.
- **`assets/`**: Images and GIFs demonstrating functionality.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.
- **`LICENSE`**: Open-source license.
